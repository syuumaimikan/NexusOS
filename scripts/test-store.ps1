.SYNOPSIS
    Opens the package window from the desktop and installs something with it.

.DESCRIPTION
    The installing machinery has been on this system for some time and had
    nowhere to be seen. This checks the window that shows it, and the two
    answers a package manager has to get right:

      * a package whose signature does not hold is refused, and the refusal
        happens before anything is written;
      * a package that is signed by the key this machine trusts is installed,
        and the record of what is installed is updated so that the updater and
        this window agree afterwards.

    The disk carries three packages on purpose -- a good one, a newer one, and
    one with a byte changed after signing -- which is what makes both answers
    checkable without the test having to make a package itself.

.PARAMETER Timeout
    How long to wait for each stage, in seconds.

.PARAMETER Shot
    Where to put a screenshot of the window, if one is wanted.
